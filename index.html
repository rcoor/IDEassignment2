    <h1>Project 2 - Temperature Data</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In this assignment we want to answer the question: <i>How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?</i>.
        <br/> To answer this question we will use temperature data for Copenhagen, Denmark provided by the <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/">NASA</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Visualization</h2>
        <p>
            To investigate how the weather has changed over the past 100 years, we will do 2 different visualization using D3.<br/>
            The first plot is a barplot of how the average temperatures each year has changed in celsius.
            <br/>
            The Bar chart doesn't show the temperatures per month, and if we are dealing with high changes when it is winter and summer we could find out
            that the cold months are getting colder, and the warm months are getting warmer.<br/> The second plot is therefor a multilineplot
            of how the average temperatures each month has changed for each year in celsius.
            <br/>
            The multilineplot is created by adapting our data to an existing visualization we found online.
            <br/>

        <h3>Bar plot</h3>
        <div class="barChart">
            <svg width="1500" height="500"></svg>
            <p>
                Yellow indicates that the year's temperature is above the average temperature since 1880 till 2015.
                <br> Blue indicates that the year's temperature is below the average temperature since 1880 till 2015.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Multilineplot</h3>
        <div class="multiLine">
            <svg width="1024" height="600"></svg>
        </div>
        <div class="multiLine2">
            <svg width="1024" height="600"></svg>
        </div>
        <p>
            The multiline plot has been used to show temperatures for each month from the year 1880 to 2015. Each line represents
            a year. Each line has been given a color on a d3 color scheme that goes from blue, the year 1880, to yellow, the
            year 2015. This was to illustrate a likely correlation of the year and rise in temperature.
        </p>

        <!-- Results here-->

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <h3>Barplot</h3>
        <p>
            The barplot gives a good overview on how the overall changes in temperature per year has changed. There are a general pattern
            of increasing temperatures, however it is hard to tell if the changes are more significant, since maybe the cold
            months are getting colder and the warm months are getting warmer.
        </p>
        <h3>Multiline plot</h3>
        <p>
            In a sense the multiline plot is biased towards indicating that there is a temperature increase due to the color scheme chosen.
            The plot has been drawn by starting at the year 1880 and continuing until 2015, which results in earlier years
            being overwritten by the yellow color of newer years. In general it's hard to see what is actually going on and
            to infer anything meaningful. Improvements to the plot, see individual answers, might yield a different visual
            result.
        </p>

        <h2>Individual part</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <small>Theis Jakobsen</small>
        <p>
            From the data plottet in the barplot we can visually infer that there is a rise in temperature over last decade. This is
            alone only clearly visible due to the color categorization of the bars. It is however not clearly visible if
            there is a gradual rise in temperature over the last century. A dataset containing a distance to a mean temperature
            before a certain date would make it easier to determine temperature shifts. Such a dataset, ofcourse, could be
            obtained by transforming the current dataset. Errors on each temperature measurement would also be welcome. Right
            now the multiline plot is very cluttered. It's hard to see differences between the years that have been plotted.
            Using the same method, as describe before, for the multiline and the barplot would improve it's message.
        </p>
        <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <small>Christian Gr&uuml;ner</small>
        <p>
            The visualization we have created are all static, and holds a lot of information, and categories. To make
            a better overview and easily readable visualization I have some ideas for the two visualizations we have made.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Barplot.</b><br/>
                    It is hard to make the bar plot smaller in terms of categories. However an improvement to the bar plot,
                    could be to be able to choose a certain month, which then gives an overview for all the categories.
                    Another improvement would be to let the viewer select if he wants to see the result as an average or
                    as a change in temperatures using a bias. A third improvement would be to let the viewer select which years
                    he want to compare, this will also make the plot much smaller and easier to read.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Multilineplot.</b><br/>
                    Make it possible to let the viewer select if he wants to compare the average or the change in temperatures
                    using a bias. Another option would be to select which years to compare and then change the colors indicating
                    the year to match the selected years.
                </li>

            </ol>

        </p>
        <h3>Question 3</h3>
        <small>Theis Jakobsen</small>
        <p>
            There are a few limiting factors to working with large data. Firstly we have to consider the file size and the bandwidth
            of the client and the server. There work that has to be done on the data will also have it's limitations and
            lastly the data will need to be rendered. Inheritely it does not seem like that there is a specific file size
            limit on creating d3 visualizations. Choosing a force-layout would require lots of interactions that constantly
            needs to be calculated and a too large file size that includes too many nodes would definetly have an effect
            on performance. In this case initial reducing of the dataset would be an option. Simply remove the number of
            nodes. If you displayed a bar chart then the amount of datapoints may not be a problem for performance but would
            quickly become a problem in terms of communication (wide barchart would be hard to dechipher). Again the solution
            could be to reduce the dataset by creating larger bins. It would also be a good idea to do transformations on
            the dataset before serving it to D3 to reduce load.
