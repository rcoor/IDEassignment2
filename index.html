    <h1>Project 2 - Temperature Data</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    In this assignment we want to answer the question: <i>How has the weather changed over the past 100 years?</i>.
    <br/> To answer this question we will use temperature data for Copenhagen, Denmark provided by the <a href="http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/station_data/">NASA</a>.

    <h2>Visualization</h2>
    To investigate how the weather has changed over the past 100 years, we will do 2 different visualization using D3.<br/>    The first plot is a bar plot of how the average temperatures each year has changed in celsius.<br/> The Bar chart doesn't
    show the temperatures per month, and if we are dealing with high changes when it is winter and summer we could find out
    that the cold months are getting colder, and the warm months are getting warmer.<br/> The second plot is therefor a multi
    line plot of how the average temperatures each month has changed for each year in celsius.
    <br/> The multi line plot is created by adapting our data to an existing visualization we found online.

    <h3>Bar plot</h3>
    <div class="barChart">
        <svg width="1800" height="500"></svg>
        <p>
            Yellow indicates that the year's temperature is above the average temperature since 1880 till 2015.
            <br> Blue indicates that the year's temperature is below the average temperature since 1880 till 2015.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Results here-->
    The bar plot gives a good overview on how the overall changes in temperature per year has changed. There are a general pattern
    of increasing temperatures, however it is hard to tell if the changes are more significant, since maybe the cold months
    are getting colder and the warm months are getting warmer.

    <h3>Multi line plot</h3>
    <div class="multiLine">
        <svg width="600" height="600"></svg>
    </div>
    <div class="temperature">

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <h2>Individual part</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Question 1</h3>
        <small>Theis Jakobsen</small>
        <p>
            From the data plottet in the bar-plot we can visually infer that there is a rise in temperature over last decade. This is
            alone only clearly visible due to the color categorization of the bars. It is however not clearly visible if
            there is a gradual rise in temperature over the last century. A dataset containing a distance to a mean temperature before a certain date would make it easier to determine
        </p>
        <h3>Question 2</h3>
        <small>Christian Gr√ºner</small>
        <p>
            I have chosen to answer the question: <i>Which dynamic elements or interactions could improve your article?</i>
            <br/> The visualization we have created are all static, and holds a lot of information, and categories. To make
            a create a better overview and easily readable visualization I have some ideas for both of the visualizations.
